# Problem 2: Phase-concurrent hash table

You need to implement the functions "find", "insert", and "remove" in the file hashtable.h

To install parlay and prepare for compilation:

`> mkdir build`

`> cd build`

`> cmake ..`

To compile from inside the build folder:

`> make`

To run:

`> ./hashtable 1000`
